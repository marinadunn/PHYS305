Purpose: This program aims to model the motion of a skydiver as he jumps from a certain height above the Earth, and falls back to the ground. He will eventually reach a terminal velocity. We will approximate the time at which he opens his parachute at a height of 1000 m from the ground. This model will use quadratic drag force, which most closely resembles real atmospheric air resistance.


Usage:
to compile: $gcc DunnM_hw07_p5.c -o DunnM_hw07_p5.exe -lm
to run: $DunnM_hw07_p5.exe
