Purpose: The goal of this program is to use the relaxation method to find the temperature distribution inside an insulated rectangular region with a circular cavity in the center. The temperature of the rectangular region obeys Laplace's equation.We use a fixed grid size of 20 x 20. For all points interior to the rectangular region, we assume the intial temperature to be 0 when starting each iteration, unless they are inside the circular region, in which case, the initial T is 80 degrees. In this case, we start at a particular point: r=(1.0,1.0).

Usage: [Temperature units are in Celcius, distance units are in Centimeters] 
Laplace's equation, gradient^2 V(r) = 0, in a region where no charge exists, or p=0, where V is the electrostatic potential on the boundary of the region. If you know this, then you can find the unique solution to Laplace's equation.
